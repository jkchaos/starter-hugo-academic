abstract: With the popularity of social media platforms, user-generated content
  (UGC) has become one of the most important forms of advertising. As the
  competition for user flow becomes fierce, both UGC platforms and UGC creators
  want a deep understanding of the effectiveness of the textual and visual
  factors contained. We conduct the elaboration likelihood model to examine the
  moderating effect of user motivation on the relationship between factors and
  users' attitudes. Also, we look into the interaction between the central route
  and the peripheral route. This research helps the UGC platform in reducing the
  cost of filtering low-quality content and interpreting UGC characteristics.
  Additionally, this research provides the preliminary fact to support the
  gradual movement between the two routes. In future research, we will continue
  our test on the ELM continuum question.
